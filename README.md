## üèÅ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:
*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14.0.0 or later)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v7.0.0 or later)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/rxease_ai.git
    ```
2.  Navigate into the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd rxease_ai
    ```
3.  Install the necessary NPM packages:
    ```sh

    ```

## üìú Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and copy all the configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them.
